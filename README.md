# Face-recognition-using-PCA-and-SVM
A real-time system for finding and seeing faces using a webcam. 
The program is based on a combination of the Viola-Jones method,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector
Machine (SVM). 
The Viola-Jones method is used to find faces.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the feature and reduce the size. 
And Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for the separation process.
